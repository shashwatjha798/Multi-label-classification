# MIDAS@IIIT-D (http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/)

Dataset - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pLv0fNE4WHokpJHUIs-FTVnmI9STgog05e658qEON0I/edit?usp=sharing
The dataset consists of 20,000 rows and 15 columns.

The aim of this project is to identify the product category with the help of it's description. Therefore we are using the product description as our main feature and category as target. 

We will use Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for this classification.

We are using Jupyter Notebook for coding purpose. 

The libraries which we are going to use are as follows:
- Pandas
- Scikit learn
- Regex
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
